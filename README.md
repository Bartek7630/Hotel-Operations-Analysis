# Hotel-Operations-Analysis

In this project, I conducted an advanced analysis using SQL, specifically the PostgreSQL dialect. The analysis was based on data from a hotel chain, and the database included three tables: Service, Request, and Branch. Each table contained multiple columns and a large amount of data, which required several steps and observations — including handling missing data and transforming it. The steps I performed were:

1. I transformed the data by replacing missing and incorrect values.

2. I analyzed the average and maximum response times, broken down by branch and service type.

3. For each service type and the location it was sent from, I identified the lowest ratings. This helped reveal which combinations received the poorest feedback and where service improvements are needed.

4. I identified cases where the average rating for a service type and hotel branch was below 4.5 — a threshold considered undesirable by the hotel chain.
